# Simple Shell Project

# Overview
This project involves creating a simple Unix shell program. A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. In this project, we will build a simple version of a shell (hsh) using various system calls and functions allowed in Unix/Linux environments.

# Project Objectives
* To understand the workings of a Unix shell.
* To learn how to interact with the kernel and gain a deeper understanding of system calls.
* To apply knowledge of C programming to create a functional shell.
* To practice using system-level functions for file and process management.

# Features
* The program will replicate functionalities of a traditional Unix shell.
* It will handle commands input from standard input (stdin).
* The program will execute commands in the PATH or specified with a full path.
* Error handling will be implemented for invalid commands or arguments.
  
# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
* Write a README with the description of your project
* You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker

# Compilation

Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

# Testing

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:


## Explain
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$

But also in non-interactive mode:


## Explain
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
