# Simple Shell Project

# Overview
This project involves creating a simple Unix shell program. A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. In this project, we will build a simple version of a shell (hsh) using various system calls and functions allowed in Unix/Linux environments.

# Project Objectives
* To understand the workings of a Unix shell.
* To learn how to interact with the kernel and gain a deeper understanding of system calls.
* To apply knowledge of C programming to create a functional shell.
* To practice using system-level functions for file and process management.

# Features
* The program will replicate functionalities of a traditional Unix shell.
* It will handle commands input from standard input (stdin).
* The program will execute commands in the PATH or specified with a full path.
* Error handling will be implemented for invalid commands or arguments.
